# INTELLISENSE LABORATORY
### Intelligent sensing measurement and control laboratory

Intelligent Sensing Measurement and Control Laboratory or IntelliSense Lab is a research oriented lab which focuses on bringing cutting edge technologies and emerging computer scientific concepts together to formulate useful solutions for practically perceived day to day problems around us.

While facilitating undergraduate and postgraduate students in pursuing their projects by providing them with required equipment and guidance, we encourage and back the researchers in fostering innovative ideas to end up in commercializable products and solutions. We thus pave the way for a journey beyond a mere thesis or a degree certificate for students by helping them identify worthy problems to solve and directing them to right paths and avenues in solving such problems.

We network and partner with local and global institutes and industry to inculcate research and engineering culture for world class research and innovation.
